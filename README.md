## About Me
I am a first year Ph.D. student advised by Dr. Mark Urban in the UConn EEB department. My interests lie in applying contemporary evolution and genetic information to on-the ground conservation. I have previously studied the factors that put mining bee populations at risk of extinction and the conditions that may have contributed to DDT resistance in caddisflies in the Pacfic Northwest.
